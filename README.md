# CitiBike-Analysis
Analysis utilizing Tableau

After reviewing the data, there were a couple of questions that I wanted to answer:

What is the demographic breakdown of these users?
Does bike use vary by age and gender?
What hours are the bikes used the most?
Does bike use vary by season?

Based on the dataset, I discovered the primary users were males between the ages of 30-33. I also provided a monthly breakdown of usage by gender and found that males were consistently higher users than females across all months. Interestingly, even though males between the ages of 30-33 were the highest users, they tended to have a shorter trip duration when compared to users between the ages of 15-20. This was true of both males and females. Users that were between the ages of 15-20 had an average duration that lasted two to three times as long as users between the ages of 30-35. This makes sense to me because I feel the younger users would tend to ride bikes more for the fun of it, whereas older users may just use it as a means to travel between different bars or restaurants.

I also wated to review the usage by season and hour. Based on my charts, it was clear that the heaviest usage occured in the morning hours of 8am followed by the evening hours 6pm-8pm. This pattern was consistent across all seasons, with Summer having the highest usage and Winter having the lowest usage. This makes sense to me as well. Most people would like to ride bikes during the summer when the weather is nice, unlike the winter when it's cold along the possibility of snow. I also took a look at the most used bike stations. Grove St PATH was the highest used bike station by far, followed by Hamilton Park and Sip Ave. I also plotted the top 5 bike stations by season to see how the usage varied by season. Grove St PATH was dominant across all seasons. Hamilton Park was consistently second for all seasons except for the Winter.
